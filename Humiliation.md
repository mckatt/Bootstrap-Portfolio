# Bootstrap-Portfolio 

Left a note in the other repository as well.

I am lost. in class, the concepts as fast as they come, I feel that I THINK i understand, but when I get home i get more and lost.
The longer i study, it feels the more confused i'm getting.
It feels like i know less and understand concepts the moretime I put in and its scring the &^%$ out of me.

Will contact staff Tuesday for help.

I subitted CRAP for the homework but, you did say to submit something.

<Acheivement unlocked> Humiliation.
